We will use Codepen extensively in class to experiment with CSS and learn concepts. Once you have an account you can *fork* (copy) the *pens* (snippets of HTML and CSS).

Once we start learning CSS, Codepen will function as "notes" for the class, as I will frequently post links to sample pens, and you will work on some pens in class. These sample pens can be used as references when youÂ build your website.

Create a free account on [Codepen](https://codepen.io/accounts/signup/user/free).

After you create your account, you need to change some settings. In your Codepen settings, find CSS Reset, and select "Include Normalize." Next, enable Autocomplete:

After you change your settings, submit your Codepen account profile page URL through Learning Suite.

Your profile page URL will include your username. For example, my username is *lsburton* and my Codepen account URL is

[https://codepen.io/lsburton](https://codepen.io/lsburton)
