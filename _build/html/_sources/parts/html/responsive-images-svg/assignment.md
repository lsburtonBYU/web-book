* - **Readability**

    HTML source follows the [HTML/CSS Style Guide for the course](../html-basics/style-guide.md).

    *Basically this means you should have formatters installed so your code is properly formatted.*

  - 5
* - **HTML only**

    No CSS or HTML style tags are used. If you use even one `<br>` tag you will receive a 0 on the assignment :D

    *I'm breaking bad habits early. No `<br>` tags are allowed in this course.*[^footnote-br]

    [^footnote-br]: I'm being overly strict, but I want you to get in the habit of using CSS for layout and spacing.  `<br>` tags have some use, but I maintain you can build a website without them. If you want to use them, you can, but you will receive a 0 on the assignment.
