# Style guide assignment

## Assignment

````{exercise}
:label: create-style-guide

**Create a style guide for your website and choose a site topic.** Include a color palette and a font palette using two Google Fonts. Submit a PDF of your style guide, including the site topic, in #style-guides channel on Slack.

**Before beginning the assignment**, complete the following steps:

1. Review the pages in this section.

    - [Accessibility](accessibility.md)
    - [Color on the Web](color.md)
    - [Useful links](useful-links.md)

2. Watch Khan Academy's videos on the RGB and HSL color models.

    - [RGB color model](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/pixar/color/color-101/v/color-2) *~3 minutes*
    - [HSL color model](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/pixar/color/color-101/v/color-3)  *~2 minutes*

3. Read Steve Schoger's [Building your color palette](https://www.refactoringui.com/previews/building-your-color-palette) to learn how to not overdo on color choices.

4. Scan

    - Smashing Magazine's [Color Theory for Designers - Part 1](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/01/color-theory-for-designers-part-1-the-meaning-of-color/)
    - a few color palettes at some of the links in [Color on the Web page](color.md)

**Create your style guide**

Include the following in your style guide:

- a color palette
- a font palette using two Google Fonts

I recommend using [FontPair](https://fontpair.co/) to find complementary Google fonts.

You are welcome modify my [simple style guide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GJz0so0V33IxH7s34RNLFI64Nzz7hMsVDhTOOh24Xu8/edit?usp=sharing) in Google Slides, which is based on Zech Nelson's style guides, [here](https://dribbble.com/shots/1718657-Style-Guides) and [here](https://dribbble.com/shots/1883273-Style-Guidelines). Another popular style guide format is [Style Tiles](http://styletil.es/).

Before you submit, check that your background and foreground color choices have enough contrast by using the [WebAIM Color Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).

**Add a second page with your site topic**. Since this class is more about learning the underlying tech, the topic isn't that important. Choose something that interests you and that you can easily write about and find images for. Remember, we will share sites in class, so don't pick a super personal topic that you wouldn't want other students to see.

Submit a PDF of your style guide and site topic in #style-guides on Slack.
