Learn how to use CSS stylesheets. Add web fonts to your website, create a button class to style links to appear as "web buttons," and adjust whitespace to keep your pages from looking crowded. Style your footer.

**Concepts covered**: CSS resets, box-model, CSS variables, pseudo-classes, simple transitions.
