## Image editing

- [Compressor.io](https://compressor.io/) \- online image compressor
- [Photoscape](http://www.photoscape.org/ps/main/download.php) \- (Windows) an older program that I still use. I don't like Photoscape X, so avoid that version, unless you are a Mac user and want to try it out.
- [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) \- (free) open source alternative to Adobe Photoshop
- [remove.bg](https://www.remove.bg/) \- remove image background - because cool
