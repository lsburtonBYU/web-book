# Whitespace and font size observations learning task

```{exercise}
:label: whitespace-font-observation-assignment
**Explore how different websites use whitespace, observe the fonts size and line spacing, and see if you can identify some trends**

I find that students who take time to observe well designed websites' use of whitespace and fonts, particularly font sizes, build better-looking websites.

You will complete this assignment by posting observations in the `#aa-learning-tasks` channel on  Slack.

On Slack, I encourage you to ask questions and comment on other students' posts as discussion helps in the learning process.

You will receive credit for this assignment if you **make at least two helpful comments or observation posts**.

**Instructions**

**Review the following article**: [Awwards what to do with whitespace](https://www.awwwards.com/what-to-do-with-whitespace.html) 

**Pick a few websites from the list below,** or choose a "modern" website that you like – you aren't limited to the list. Be aware that older legacy sites like ESPN don't have great whitespace.

- [Apple](https://www.apple.com/)
- [Pocket Penguins](https://www.pocketpenguins.com/)
- [Juliana Cavalcanti](https://www.juliana-cavalcanti.com/)
- [Sonos](https://www.sonos.com/en-us/home)
- [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) (Shopify hosts most small business sites on the web theses days, so their templates help shape popular design)
- [Everlane](https://www.everlane.com/)
- [Simpla](https://www.madesimpla.com/en/)
- [SeedLip](https://www.seedlipdrinks.com/en-us/)
- [Harvard Art Museums](https://harvardartmuseums.org/)
- [Square Space](https://www.squarespace.com/)
- [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/)

(I may add more)

**Take some time to explore how these sites use whitespace and observe the fonts size and line spacing** and see if you can identify some trends (there definitely is a trend toward big fonts and less content).

Open the **Font view in Firefox's Dev Tools** to view the font information.

**Highlight elements in the DOM inspector and view the Layout pane** to see their paddings, borders, and margins.

Post questions, observations, suspected trends, screenshots, videos, memes, etc. on Slack. If you find a really cool website, share it. Also, you can disagree with designs. That's fine. I want your honest insights. There's no "right way" to design a website, but as humans, we do tend to follow trends but also have personal style preferences.

```{tip}
If you see something interesting on a website (cf. Pocket Penguin site) and you'd like to know how they created it, I have a `#howd-they-do-that` channel on Slack for that. I frequently base in-class exercises off website features that students are interested in learning how to replicate. Our next big module is animation, and while I think animation is overused, there are some cool ones out there in the wild
